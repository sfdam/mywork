    <!-- 1. Introduction -->
    <div class="uniqueBlock">
      <h2 class="subSectionName">1. <span class="subSectionSpace"/>Introduction</h2>
      <p>In accordance with Articles 13 and 14 of EU Regulation 2016/679 (the “Regulation”), Banca Ifis S.p.A. (the “Bank” or “Data Controller”), as Data Controller, wishes to inform its customers, including potential customers, guarantors, coobligors and third-party payers, and third parties in general (e.g. attorneys, legal representatives, etc.) who come into contact or may come into contact with the Bank as a representative or under customer mandate (“Data Subjects”), that their personal data (“Data”) will be processed lawfully, correctly and transparently, in accordance with the methods and for the purposes shown below.</p>
      <p>
      If the Data Subject is a legal person, the following information is also provided with regard to the personal data of natural persons who legally and / or organically represent it, of which the Data Controller becomes aware.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!-- 2. Sources of personal data -->
    <div class="uniqueBlock">
      <h2 class="subSectionName">2. <span class="subSectionSpace"/>Sources of personal data</h2>
      <p>The Data to be processed by the Data Controller will be acquired, directly by the Bank and/or via third-party entities duly appointed for the purpose, from Data Subjects and/or third-parties (entities that perform transactions for the Data Subject, commercial and credit information companies, external market research companies, etc.). This will include the use of distance communication techniques which the Data Controller uses (e.g. websites, apps for smartphone and tablet, call centres, etc.). Data will also be used that is provided by public sources, such as public registers and lists, documents that can be accessed by the public (e.g. financial statements, information contained in business registers held by Chambers of Commerce, property deeds and other prejudicial documents, such as registration of collateral or transcription of distraint proceedings, injunctions or other legal documents), and Data extracted from publicly accessible sources, such as newspapers or digital versions of newspapers, information available from telephone directories, and the websites of public bodies or other Regulatory authorities and control bodies.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- 3. Purposes of processing and legal basis -->
    <div class="uniqueBlock">
      <h2 class="subSectionName">3. <span class="subSectionSpace"/>Purposes of processing and legal basis</h2>
      <p>Data will be processed as part of the Data Controller’s normal business activities, for the following purposes:</p>
      <ol class="numericList1">
        <li class="ElementList1">to fulfil legal obligations, both national and European, and orders/provisions from Public and/or Regulatory Authorities (e.g. obligations imposed by legislation to combat money laundering, terrorism, child pornography and tax evasion, etc.);</li>
        <li class="ElementList1">to fulfil obligations arising from a contract entered into with the Data Subject and/or that are necessary to enter into a contract, including managing and fulfilling specific requests from the Data Subject, and other activities which are connected and instrumental to the performance and management of the relationship (e.g. credit assessment; payment management; checks on the performance of the relationship, and its connected risks; securitisation of credits; credit insurance; payment transactions, including international transactions, such as, cross-border bank transfers, for which it is necessary to use the SWIFT international messaging service, etc.);</li>
        <li class="ElementList1">
          <p><u>after receiving specific consent</u>:</p>
          <p>c.1) to identify the Data Subject’s tastes, preferences, habits, needs and consumer choices (profiling) for direct marketing purposes (only where the Data Subject is a natural person);</p>
          <p>c.2) to promote and supply banking products/services or to carry out market research aimed at determining the Data Subject’s level of satisfaction;</p>
          <p>c.3) to promote and supply third-party products/services;</p>
          <p>c.4) to disclose personal Data to third parties in order to promote and supply the Bank’s products/services or to carry out market research aimed at determining the Data Subject’s level of satisfaction;</p>
          <p>c.5) to disclose personal Data to third parties in order for them to promote and supply their products/services.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="ElementList1">D) to pursue the Data Controller’s legitimate interests (e.g. protecting business assets; debt recovery; accounting and audit; credit monitoring; monitoring and assessment of the quality of service; managing disputes, that is lodging or defending a claim in and out of court; etc.).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>With regard to the purposes under points A) and B), Data will be processed by the Data Controller, including concerning their communication to entities referred to in paragraph 7 and, within the limits in which this communication is functional to the pursuance of the related purposes, without the need for consent, given that the legal basis for processing is, respectively, to fulfil a legal obligation and the contract or to manage activities that are necessary for the purposes of entering into a contract. If the Data Subject refuses to provide the necessary information, it will be impossible for the Data Controller to enter into the relationship with the Data Subject. With regards to the purposes under point C), the Data subject has the right not to give consent, and to oppose, at any time, the Data Controller performing the processing operations set out, since the legal basis for processing is the Data Subject’s consent. The only consequence of refusing to give consent is that the Data Subject will not be able to make use of the related services, without this leading to any negative consequences. Consent may be revoked at any time without having any negative effect on the legitimacy of data processing already carried out. In relation to the purposes under point D), the Data Subject’s consent is not necessary, since the legal basis for processing is the Data Controller’s legitimate interests, taking into account the balance of the Data Controller’s rights with those of the Data Subject.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- 4. Categories of Personal Data -->
    <div class="uniqueBlock">
      <h2 class="subSectionName">4. <span class="subSectionSpace"/>Categories of Personal Data</h2>
      <p>The following categories of personal Data may be processed for the purposes set out at paragraph 3: identification and contact data (e.g. name, surname, place and date of birth, e-mail address, tax reference number, profession and sector of activity, user name and password used to access systems that the Data Controller makes available to the Data Subject, including mobile applications), and data relating to their connection with other persons; data relating to transactions (e.g. current account number, deposits and withdrawals, the amount and date of transactions, data identifying other banking relationships, IBAN number); financial data (e.g. statement of financial position and cash flow situation, payment history, financial trustworthiness and punctuality of payment); data that can identify tastes, preferences, habits, needs and consumer choices; criminal record data. The Data Controller, limited to what is necessary to pursue the purposes set out at paragraph 3, may become aware of and process data that the Regulation defines as a special category of personal Data (e.g. data revealing racial and ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, as well as genetic data, biometric data, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation), if these have been sent directly by the Data Subject.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- 5. Methods used to process personal Data -->
    <div class="uniqueBlock">
      <h2 class="subSectionName">5. <span class="subSectionSpace"/>Methods used to process personal Data</h2>
      <p>Data are processed using manual, computerised and telematic tools, with an approach that is strictly linked to the purposes set out above and, in any case, in compliance with the necessary care, guarantees and measures prescribed by the relevant legislative and regulatory provisions, aimed at ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Data, as well as avoiding damage, whether material or non-material (e.g. loss of control of personal Data or limitation of rights, discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial losses, unauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation, damage to reputation, loss of confidentiality of personal Data protected by professional secrecy or any other significant economic or social disadvantage).</p>
      <p>The processing carried out by the Data Controller may be based on automated decision-making processes which have legal effect or which have similar significant effect on the Data Subject, including profiling: in particular, the Data Controller adopts an automated system aimed at profiling Data Subjects based on credit behaviour and adopting subsequent decisions on the profile generated as part of the credit assessment process connected with a credit application (credit scoring) and a partially-automated system aimed at profiling Data Subjects based on credit behaviour and adopting subsequent decisions on the profile generated as part of the bad debt reports regarding the Data Subject held by the Central Risk Register and credit information systems. The Central Risk Register is an information system, managed by the Bank of Italy, that collects information provided by banks and financial institutions regarding credit granted to their customers and regarding the related guarantees and which provides an overview of all personal and business debts owed to the banking and financial system. The credit information systems are the banks’ private databases consulted by banks and financial institutions to make credit assessments and to see information on payment punctuality and are required to assess the appropriateness of granting consumer credit, loans and financing in whatever technical form. The use of the Central Risk Register and credit information systems mean that customers with a good credit history can obtain financing more easily and under better terms and conditions. Banks and financial institutions use them to assess a customer’s ability to repay financing granted. Therefore, the credit scoring system used in the credit application process, and the bad debt reports regarding Data Subjects held by the Central Risk Register and credit information systems, may have the effect of preventing a Data Subject from being granted financing. The statistical analysis models or factors, and the decision calculation algorithm, indicators or points used as part of this process, are checked at least annually and are updated where the results of these checks require it.</p>

    <!-- 6. Transfer of data to non-EU countries/organisations -->
    <div class="uniqueBlock">
      <h2 class="subSectionName">6. <span class="subSectionSpace"/>Transfer of data to non-EU countries/organisations</h2>
      <p>Where it is necessary to achieve the purposes referred to in paragraph 3, a Data Subject’s Data may be transferred abroad, to countries/organisations outside the EU which guarantee a level of personal Data protection that the European Commission deems to be appropriate, or in any case based on other appropriate safeguards, for example, the Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission.</p>
      <p>A copy of any Data transferred abroad, as well as the list of non-EU countries/organisations to which Data have been transferred, may be requested from the Data Controller using the contact details indicated in paragraphs 9 and 10.</p>

    <!-- 9. The Data Subject’s rights -->
    <div class="uniqueBlock">
      <h2 class="subSectionName">9. <span class="subSectionSpace"/>The Data Subject’s rights</h2>
      <p>Pursuant to Articles 15 to 22, the Regulation enables Data Subjects to exercise specific rights.</p>

    <div class="uniqueBlock">
      <p class="sectionName sectionNameTopLine">PRIVACY POLICY WITH REGARD TO FUND TRANSFERS USING THE SWIFT SERVICE</p>
      <p>To carry out international financial transactions (e.g. a cross-border bank transfer) and some specific national transactions requested by customers, it is necessary to use an international messaging service. This service is managed by the “Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication” (SWIFT), with headquarters in Belgium.</p>
      <p>The Bank communicates data to SWIFT (owner of the SwiftNet Fin system) regarding anyone who carries out these types of transaction (e.g. payer’s name, payee’s name, the name of their respective banks, bank details and the amount). Otherwise, the Bank could not carry out the transactions requested by customers.</p>
      <p>It should also be noted that:</p>
      <ul style="margin-top:0cm;" type="disc">
        <li>all customer data used to carry out these financial transactions are – for reasons of operational security – currently duplicated and transmitted, and a copy is temporarily stored by SWIFT on one of the company’s servers located in the United States;</li>
        <li>the data stored on this server is accessible and can be used in the USA, in accordance with local counter-terrorism legislation, by the relevant US authorities (e.g. the Department of the Treasury).</li>

      <p>The Bank wishes to inform Data Subjects who have an existing finance lease contract that it uses a system to record telephone calls as part of its activities to sell insurance by telephone in connection with leasing products already granted. These activities are carried out by a third-party company, specially designated as Data Processor. This recording system is aimed at providing proof of the foundation of relationships, managing the relationships and monitoring the quality of the service made available to the user. These recordings will be kept confidential and stored in accordance with the law at the third-party company’s offices for 10 years from the moment in which their effects expire.</p>
      <p>Telephone calls are recorded using automated systems which record outgoing calls. Appropriate measures are adopted that guarantee the security and confidentiality of the collected data, as set out by current legislation on the protection of personal Data. The audio files that are generated can only be accessed by individuals who are expressly authorised to process Personal Data.</p>
      <p>The Bank wishes to inform Data Subjects who own an account contract that it uses a system to record inbound and outbound telephone calls managed by Customer Services in order to analyse and monitor the quality of the processes and services provided to customers, and to be used as proof in cases of any eventual disputes.</p>
      <p>Telephone calls are recorded using automated systems which record incoming and outgoing calls. Appropriate measures are adopted that guarantee the security and confidentiality of the collected data, as set out by current legislation on the protection of personal Data. Recordings will be stored with restricted access and kept only for the time strictly necessary to achieve the purposes for which they were made. In any case, the maximum storage period will not exceed 10 years from the date the recordings were made, unless circumstances occur which require files to be stored for a longer period, in accordance with current legislation. Telephone call recordings can be accessed by persons expressly authorised to process personal Data, in order to protect the Bank’s workers and company assets from direct or indirect damage which may result from disputes raised by customers, to monitor the quality of the service made available to the user, to fulfil internal audit obligations as set out by legislation and/or regulatory provisions to guarantee that customers and/or company assets are protected and to satisfy requests from external control bodies (Consob, Bank of Italy, external auditor, etc.), that are legally allowed to access telephone call recordings in their role as independent Data Controllers.</p>

    <p>This policy pursuant to Art. 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is also provided on behalf of the credit information systems.</p>
    <p>Dear Customer, <br/>
    As the Data Controller, Banca Ifis S.p.A. would like to inform you that, in order to fulfil your request, it uses some of your personal data. This is information that you provide us or that we obtain by consulting certain databases.</p>
    <p>We will keep this information in our records. Some of the information you provide, along with information related to your payment history related to the relationship that will be established, may be periodically communicated to the credit information systems.</p>
    <p>This means that subjects belonging to the categories mentioned above, with whom you will request to establish a relationship, may know if you presented us with a request and if your payments are made regularly.</p>
    <p>Processing and communicating your data is a requirement for finalising the contract. Without these data, we may not be able to fulfil your request.</p>
    <p>The databases store this information based on the legitimate interests of the data controller to check the credit information systems.</p>
    <h4>Processing performed by the Bank</h4>
    <p>Your data may be transferred to a third country outside the EU or to an international organisation, in the manner provided for in paragraph 6 above.</p>
    <p>According to the terms, methods and applicability limits established by current legislation, you have the right to check your data and exercise the various rights relating to their use (rectification, updating, erasure, limiting processing, opposition, etc.).</p>
    <p>You may file a complaint with Garante [Italian Data Protection Authority] (www.garanteprivacy.it), as well as use the other means of protection provided by the applicable legislation.</p>
    <p>We keep your data on file with us for the time required to manage your contractual relationship and to fulfil legal obligations (e.g., the provisions of Article 2220 of the Italian Civil Code on retaining accounting records).</p>
    <p>Any request regarding your data may be sent to the Bank at privacy@bancaifis.it and/or the companies indicated below, to which we will communicate your data.</p>
    <p>Your data may be used in the automated decision-making process for a request if this decision is necessary for the finalisation or execution of your contract with us. In particular, information obtained by consulting private databases relating to loans requested and provided by other financial intermediaries is processed by our systems in order to assess the financing request submitted to the Bank. If there is negative information found in the private database, the financing request made to the Bank is rejected, and this rejection is promptly communicated to the data subject.</p>
    <p>We would also like to inform you that you can contact our Data Protection Officer, for any reason, at the following address: rpd@bancaifis.it.</p>
    <h4>Processing performed by the manager of the credit information systems</h4>
    <p>In order to better assess the credit risk, as well as the reliability and punctuality of payments, we communicate certain data (personal details, including those of the co-obligor, type of contract, amount of credit, and repayment methods) to the Credit Information Systems, which are governed by the relevant Code of Conduct and are independent data controllers.</p>
    <p>The data are also made accessible to the various private entities belonging to the categories that you will find in the information provided by the credit information system managers, available through the channels listed below.</p>
    <p>Your data are periodically updated with information acquired over the course of the relationship (payment performance, residual debt exposure, the status of the relationship).</p>
    <p>Within the credit information systems, your data will be processed according to the organisation, comparison, and processing methods strictly necessary for the purposes described above.</p>
    <p>Your data are subject to statistical processing in order to assign you a summary judgement or score on your degree of reliability and solvency (credit scoring), taking into account the following main types of factors: including but not limited to the number and characteristics of existing credit relationships, payment performance and history in relation to existing or previous relationships, possible presence and characteristics of new credit requests, history of previous credit relationships, existence or non-existence of detrimental data, etc., which make it possible to obtain, through the application of statistical methods and models, results expressed in the form of summary judgements, numerical indicators or scores aimed at providing a predictive or probabilistic representation of the risk profile, reliability or punctuality of the payments of the data subject.</p>
    <p>Some additional information may be provided if your credit request is not accepted.</p>
